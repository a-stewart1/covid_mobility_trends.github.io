### Motivation

  The central artery of New York City, the public transportation system is central to the city's cultural and economic well-being. Among its usual million daily users such as hip hop dancers, Wall Street executives, and the famous [pizza rat](https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/22/living/pizza-rat-feat/index.html), the subway proves to be more than a means of transport; it is a way of life. 

  Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic and the “New York State on PAUSE” executive order, issued on March 14, 2020 aimed to slow the spread of the virus, brought tremendous shock to the normal bustle of New York City. Closed museums, theaters, restaurants, and suspended commutes have created ghost town-like scenes and some people to proclaim that New York City is [“over”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-reopening.html?searchResultPosition=43) as we know it. 

  This project moves forward with the aim of understanding the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility trends in NYC as measured by MTA ridership on subway trains and buses from March to November 2019 and 2020. 

### Related Work 

  Understanding trends in ridership is important as it may be associated with COVID-19 transmission as well as economic implications such as decreased consumer spending. 
[Past studies](https://covid-mobility.stanford.edu/) have predicted higher infection rates among disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic groups solely from differences in mobility data. [Similar studies](https://visualization.covid19mobility.org/?date=2020-11-26&dates=2020-08-26_2020-11-26&region=36) have focused on mobility trends at the county level and fail to look at mobility trends by mode of transportation. Our study adds to this important topic as it compares mobility trends by mode of transportation (bus, subway etc.). 

  Understanding this important issue could provide insight to policymakers, transit authorities, and health departments as they make decisions related to transmission of COVID-19 and modifications to public transportation systems in light of stay-at-home orders.


### Research Questions: 

* How has the COVID-19 pandemic influenced trends in subway and bus ridership in NYC from March to November 2020? 

* Does average MTA subway ridership from March to November 2019 differ from MTA subway ridership from March to November 2020?

* Does subway ridership differ from bus ridership during the COVID-19 pandemic (March to November 2020)?

We initially wanted to explore mobility trends by borough and expand our means of transportation to air traffic. However, we did not find adequate information on mobility trends at the borough level and realized that adding air traffic would be a bit overwhelming for the scope of this project. We identified Apple Mobility Trend data as a potential source but ultimately decided to use MTA data due to more appropriate variables. The Apple data only provided percentage change values and not the crude number of ridership, which was important for our visualization and statistical tests. Additionally, we expected to explore trends for the whole calendar year and were limited by only having available data from March to November.
