### Motivation

The central artery of New York City, the public transportation system is central to the cultural and economic well being of the city. Among its usual million daily users such as hip hop dancers, Wall Street executives, and the famous [pizza rat](https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/22/living/pizza-rat-feat/index.html), the subway proves to be more than a means of transport, it is a way of life. 

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic and the “New York State on PAUSE” executive order, issued on March 14, 2020 to slow the spread of the virus, brought tremendous shock to the normal bustle of New York city. Closed museums, theaters, and restaurants, suspended commutes, and ghost town-like scenes led some people to proclaim that New York City is [“over”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-reopening.html?searchResultPosition=43) as we know it. 

This project moves forward with the aim of understanding the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on human mobility trends in NYC as measured by MTA ridership on subway trains and buses. Understanding trends in ridership is important as it may be associated with economic implications such as consumer spending as well as COVID-19 transmission. Understanding this important issue could provide insight to policymakers, transit authorities, and health departments as they make decisions related to transmission of COVID-19 and modifications to public transportation systems in light of stay-at-home orders.

### Research Questions 

Originally, we planned to use Apple Mobility Trend data but we decided to use MTA data due to more appropriate variables. The Apple data only provided percentage change values and not the crude numbers of ridership. 

* Does average MTA subway ridership March-December 2019 differ from average MTA subway ridership March-December 2020?
* Does subway ridership differ from bus ridership during the COVID-19 pandemic (March to December 2020)?
