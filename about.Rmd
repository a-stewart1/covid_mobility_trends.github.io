# About 

![](images/200430-new-york-subway-ew-1235p_08a2968cb59418529191b5d2bd30de9c.fit-760w.jpg){width=75%} 

### Motivation

The COVID-19 pandemic and the “New York State on PAUSE” executive order, issued on March 14, 2020 to slow the spread of the virus, brought tremendous shock to the normally bustling city. Closed museums, theaters, and restaurants, suspended commutes, and ghost town-like scenes led some people to proclaim that New York City is [“over”](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-reopening.html?searchResultPosition=43) as we know it. This project intended to explore the influence of COVID-19 on human mobility trends in NYC and mobility trends throughout the pandemic as measured by MTA ridership on subway trains and buses. 

Mobility trends may be associated with both COVID-19 infection and economic implications associated with consumer spending. Thus, understanding mobility trends is crucial in order to guide policymakers, transit, and health departments as they make decisions related to stay-at-home orders in light of COVID-19.

### Research Questions 

Originally, we planned to use Apple Mobility Trend data but we decided to use MTA data due to more appropriate variables. The Apple data only provided percentage change values and not the crude numbers of ridership. 

* Does average MTA subway ridership March-December 2019 differ from average MTA subway ridership March-December 2020?
* Does subway ridership differ from bus ridership during the COVID-19 pandemic (March to December 2020)?
