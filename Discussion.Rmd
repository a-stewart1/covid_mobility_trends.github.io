What were your findings? Are they what you expect? What insights into the data can you make?

Trends: 
"we can see that the ridership values in March 2020 are similar to those of ridership in March 2019 for both buses and subways. However, from mid-March onward there are overall reduced ridership trends in 2020 as compared to 2019 for both forms of transit" 

These trends in reduced ridership align with the "New York on PAUSE" executive order, which caused many people to stop using public transportation.
